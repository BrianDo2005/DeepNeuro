# DeepNeuro

A deep learning python package for neuroimaging data.

Created by the Quantitative Tumor Imaging Lab at the Martinos Center (Harvard-MIT Program in Health, Sciences, and Technology / Massachussets General Hospital).

This package will be released soon -- feel free to snoop around in the code in the meantime. All of the features of the currently-functional https://github.com/QTIM-Lab/qtim_gbmSegmenter and https://github.com/QTIM-Lab/qtim_PreProcessor will be included in DeepNeuro, but you can use them in the meantime.
